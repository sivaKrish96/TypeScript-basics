# Data Types:

1. String
2. Number
3. Boolean
4. void
5. null
6. any
7. undefined
8. enum
9. tuple

# Type Inference:
the type inference was used to determine the data types of the assigned value to the variable automatically when you didn't mention the data type.

# enum:
enum in typescript provide a way to define a set of named constant with number or string values.

when you use the const before the enum it will avoid the unnecessary transformation of the javascript code for this enum and during the production
code make looks readable.

# Tuples:
tuples in typescript was used to declare the different type of data for array like { let employee: [num, string][] } like this.

# any:
when you didn't mention the data types the typeScript was automatically assign "any" datatype to the variable. but for the good practice you 
don't use the "any" data type.
