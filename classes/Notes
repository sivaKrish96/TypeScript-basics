# Classes:
    1. class are created for the business logics you use the classes to create the instances of the classes with "new" keyword.

    # Private key word:

        when you want to make some variable non-accessible outside of the class you put it at private this was done by two ways.
            1. using "private" keyword in front of variable
            2. or else use the "#" symbol in fron of the variable to make it private.
            3. in private variables you can only access within the class not even in the child classes you shouldn't able to access.
    
    # protected keyword:

        when you want to make the variable only accessible inside the class as well as from the child class you can use the protected keyword.
        but you can't able to acceess this variable from the instances of the classes.
    
    # Static Method:
        when you use the static keyword in any method that method is only accessable from the class level not from the instance level,
        also this static method doesn't depend on the class as well as instance changes.

        this method is only accessable from where you created and the name of the class to acess the static methods.
